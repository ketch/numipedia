# Numipedia

## An index of numerical integrators and their properties

Numipedia is a set of static webpages generated using 
[Nodepy](http://github.com/ketch/nodepy), which is a package
that automatically analyzes numerical integrators such as Runge-Kutta
and linear multistep methods.  Numipedia allows users to compare
properties of a range of integration methods with nothing more
than a web browser.

## Shortcomings
This is only meant to be an experiment in what could be achieved.
It is woefully incomplete in terms of both methods and properties.
A better implementation, which might exist in the future, would
allow the user to query a database of methods and properties in more
powerful ways.  For now, power-users should install nodepy:

    pip install nodepy

If you have a favorite method or property that is not included here,
feel free to request it in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/ketch/numipedia/issues).
